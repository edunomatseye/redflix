I've created a modern, responsive movie discovery app which I called Redflix with the following features:

Architecture:
- Organized code into components, pages, services, hooks, lib and types
- Used TypeScript for type safety
- Implemented clean separation of concerns

Features:
* Grid layout of movie posters
* Toggle between popular and top-rated movies
* Detailed movie view with all required information
* Responsive design that works on all devices
* Loading states and error handling
* Beautiful hover effects and transitions

Best Practices:
* Component-based architecture
* Custom hooks for data fetching
* Environment variables for API key
* Lazy loading images
* TypeScript interfaces for type safety
* Proper error handling
* Responsive design patterns

To use the app:
- Create a .env file in the root directory
- Copy the contents from .env.example
- Replace your_api_key_here with your TMDB API key which can be gotten from the themoviedb.org developer website when you sign up
- open a terminal and run "npm install" in the project directory.
- run "npm run dev" to start the project in dev mode.

you can:
- View popular and top-rated movies
- Click on any movie to see its details
- Add movie to favorites
- Toggle between popular and top-rated movies
- Navigate back to the home page
